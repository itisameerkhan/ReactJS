1. ## About

    Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript applications, primarily used with libraries like React for building user interfaces. It provides a centralized store to manage the state of your entire application, making state management more predictable and scalable, especially in large and complex applications.

2. ## configureStore

    The `configureStore` function is a utility function provided by the `@reduxjs/toolkit` package, which is the official Redux Toolkit. It simplifies the process of creating a Redux store by combining several commonly used Redux-related functions.
